# ProductBox Frontend Code Challenge

## Description
### RandoStore
I created using React and Tailwind CSS. It is a simple e-commerce website that allows users to browse, buy, and sell products.

### Features

- Users can view a list of all listed products.
- Users can add products to their cart and checkout.
- Users can also sell their own products by filling out a form with product details and uploading an image.
- The form uses Formik and Yup for validation and error handling.
- Users can view the details of each product.
- The website has a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

### Features
- Home: This is the landing page that shows a welcome message.
- All Products: This is the page that shows all the products available for sale.
- Cart: This is the page that shows the items in the userâ€™s cart. Users can remove items from their cart. They can also proceed to checkout.
- Error: This is the page that shows an error message when something goes wrong, such as a network failure or an invalid URL.
- Add New Product: This is the page that allows users to sell their own products. Users have to fill out a form with product details and upload an image. The form uses Formik and Yup for validation and error handling.
- Product Details: This is the page that shows the details of a specific product, such as description, reviews, and seller information. Users can also add the product to their cart or write a review.
