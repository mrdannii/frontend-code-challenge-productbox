## Description
### RandoStore
I created using React and Tailwind CSS. It is a simple e-commerce website that allows users to browse, buy, and sell products.

### Features

- Users can view a list of all products or filter them by category, price, or rating.
- Users can add products to their cart and checkout with a mock payment system.
- Users can also sell their own products by filling out a form with product details and uploading an image.
- The form uses Formik and Yup for validation and error handling.
- Users can view the details of each product, such as description, reviews, and seller information.
- The website has a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

### Features
- Home: This is the landing page that shows a welcome message and some featured products.
- All Products: This is the page that shows all the products available for sale. Users can filter and sort the products by various criteria.
- Cart: This is the page that shows the items in the userâ€™s cart. Users can edit the quantity or remove items from their cart. They can also proceed to checkout and complete their order.
- Error: This is the page that shows an error message when something goes wrong, such as a network failure or an invalid URL.
- Add New Product: This is the page that allows users to sell their own products. Users have to fill out a form with product details and upload an image. The form uses Formik and Yup for validation and error handling.
- Product Details: This is the page that shows the details of a specific product, such as description, reviews, and seller information. Users can also add the product to their cart or write a review.

## Getting Started
Install the package dependencies by running the following command ```npm install ```
```bash
npm start
npm install json-server
json-server --watch init_data.json --port 3001
```
Once the server is running, you can access the start page by opening your browser to ```http://localhost:3000```     
The Items JSON REST API is exposed at ```http://localhost:3001/items```     
### API Endpoints  
```bash
/items/
- HTTP GET: returns array of all items
- HTTP POST: creates a new item, returns the created item data
/items/:id
- HTTP GET: returns the item with given id (numeric, auto-incrementing). HTTP 404 if item not found
- HTTP DELETE: removes the items with given id, returns nothing (HTTP 204)
```
